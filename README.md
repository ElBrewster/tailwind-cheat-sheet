# **Tailwind Cheatsheet**

### What's this?
This Vite app is a quick mock-up so my friends can quickly style SPAs with Tailwind. I found the docs a bit frustrating to navigate and decided a shortcut would be great. The important bits are this README and then examples are in `App.jsx`. Feel free to beg, borrow, or steal any of it ðŸ˜Š.

And if you know a cool way to stack linear-gradients in Tailwind please @me.

### Setup
1. [Click](https://github.com/ElBrewster/Classic-Fit) to open repo. Browse, or: 
2. Click the "Fork" button. (This will create a user copy of the repository.)
3. Open the Terminal application.
4. In Terminal, use the "cd" command to navigate to where the local repository will live.
5. In GitHub, click on the green "Code' dropdown. You will see three clone options. Select "SSH" and copy the SSH key.
6. In Terminal, run "git clone [insert copied SSH key here]", and then use the "cd" command to navigate into the newly created directory.
7. Open the local repository in VS Code by typing: `code .`
8. Type `npm run dev` in your Terminal to run the Vite app.

9. To install Tailwind in your own project go [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) and for the Vite install in particular go [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite) 
    - `npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`
    - `npx tailwindcss init -p `
    - in `tailwind.config.js` add in `content: []` the following:
    ```    
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    ```
    - in index.css include:
    ```
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;
    ```
## Cheatsheet
I'll start out by hilighting this App wrapper:
`<div className='min-h-screen flex flex-col bg-blue-800'></div>`
and main tag:
`<main className='flex flex-1 flex-col'></main>`
These should give your app a good starting point by setting the content to fit screen height and having the main content fill available space with `flex-1`.
I like to do the classic header, main, footer setup for a quick SPA with semantic HTML.
<div>
    <header></header>
    <main></main>
    <footer></footer>
</div>

### Tailwind Numbers

Don't guess what number to use for sizes. Only some work.
In general, 1 = 4px
`h-px` is height of 1px
so `h-1` is height: 4px;
[Here's](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/padding#add-padding-to-a-single-side) an example of applying pixels to padding to show what I mean. `p-0` is 0px padding, `p-1` is 4px padding, and after `p-12` some numbers are skipped.

Tailwind's `text-base` is `1rem`, which is 16px in vanilla CSS.

For *font sizes* you can try `text-xs` or -sm/-base/-lg/-xl/-2xl...-9xl


### Measurements: Height, Width, Margin, Padding
Generally helpful container values:
`h-full` to fill container's height
`h-screen` or `min-h-screen` to fill viewport 
`min-h-min`, `min-h-max`
`w-screen`
`h-px` is height of 1px
so `h-1` is height: 4px;
`w-1` is width: 4px;
`p-1` is padding: 4px;
`m-1` is margin: 4px;

percentages as fractions:
`w-1/4` or `w-full` is width: 25% or width: 100%

You can add x/y for left&right, top&bottom like the x/y (vertical/horizontal) axes: 

`px-1` is padding-left and padding-right: 4px;

t,r,b,l is top, right, bottom, left, so `pt-1` is padding-top: 4px;

### Breakpoints
default breakpoints: 
sm (640px wide), 
md (768px), 
lg (1024px) 
xl (1280px), 
2xl (1536px)

Adding a value at a breakpoint looks like this: `sm:text-center` 

### Colors
The default colors are [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors). 
They are slate, gray, zinc, neutral, stone, red, orange, amaber, yellow, lime, green, emerald, teal, cyan, sky, blue, indigo, violet, purple, fuchsia, pink, rose.

You apply color using the color name and then a number (scaling from light to dark): 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 950.

`background-color: #4b5563` is written in the `className` as `bg-gray-600`:
`<div className="bg-gray-600 text-gray-100"></div>`

I included an example of how to customize colors in the tailwind.config.ts file. I labeled arbitrary numbers in-between their defaults and assigned these numbers to color hex codes. 

### Flexbox & Grid
I've included a few simple examples in `App.jsx`, however I would suggest using dev tools to get the flex properties you want and then search the tailwind docs for their syntax.

If I wanted 
```
.container{
    display: grid;
    gap: 1.5rem;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
}
```
it would be something like this:
`<div className="grid gap-5 grid-cols-3"></div>`
Or
```
.profile-form{
    align-items: flex-start;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: space-evenly;
}
```
might look like this:
`<div className="flex flex-col items-start justify-evenly"></div>`
